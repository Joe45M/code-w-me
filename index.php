                        Hi! I'm Joe. A Website Developer of four years.  <br> <br>

                        When I began learning to code, I felt stuck. There is so much to learn and it can be confusing, especially when you do not have any help. <br> <br>

                        Which is why I want to help. Everyone should be able to learn how to code without feeling lost or scared. You can think of this as a peer-learning program with mentor-like guidance.

                        A lot of people benefit from one-to-one mentoring. It can be seen as a more tailored experience as well as something more long-term. 
                        <br><br>
                        With a one-to-one system, we can set goals and perform custom exercises which are entirely fitted to your learning style, level, and needs. We can create a Google Sheet which tracks your progress and more.

                        Working in a team to problem solve, learn and meet new people can be fun, flexible and can have a positive impact on your learning experience.
